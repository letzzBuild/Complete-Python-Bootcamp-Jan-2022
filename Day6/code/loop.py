#how to implement for loop
# print numbers from 0 to 10
# for i in range(2,11,2):
#     print(i)    
# print("For loop end")  
# 
# while loop
# i = 0 
# while(i<10):
#     i = i+1
#     if i==5:
#       continue
#     print(i)
    
   
# print("While loop end")

#break statement
# is used when you want to stop the loop in between 

# continue statement
# is used when you want to skip the current iteration and continue with the next iteration

# exit(0) function
#exit function is used to stop to program
